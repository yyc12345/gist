# Minecraft Door Models Json Gen

I use Xk_Kr redstone resourcespack. When I update to 1.19, the door redstone display of this resourcespack went wrong.  
After some checks, I found the changes of door models json file. So I write this json generator to generate corresponding json file with the reference of old textures name of Xe_Kr resourcespack. Then I do not need to change any more new texture files.
